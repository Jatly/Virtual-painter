<h1>AI Paint Tool Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This project demonstrates how to create an AI-powered paint tool that allows users to draw and paint on a digital canvas using hand gestures. The system uses computer vision techniques powered by OpenCV and machine learning to recognize gestures, enabling intuitive control over drawing tools.

<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>1. Gesture-Based Drawing:</h3> Control brush strokes, colors, and other drawing tools using hand gestures.
<h3>2. Computer Vision for Hand Tracking:</h3> Real-time hand detection and tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
<h3>3. Machine Learning for Gesture Recognition:</h3> Trained machine learning models classify hand gestures to trigger different drawing action.
<h3>4. Intuitive Interface:</h3> A user-friendly interface that makes digital drawing accessible and fun.
